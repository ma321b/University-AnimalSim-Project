Project: foxes-and-rabbits
Authors: Michael KÃ¶lling and David J. Barnes


A predator-prey simulation involving foxes and rabbits in
an enclosed rectangular field.

A part of my university's project to which I have added further 
functionality while working as a part of a team of two.

(See commit messages to learn the functionality added)

How to start:
    Create a Simulator object.
    Then call one of:
        + simulateOneStep - for a single step.
        + simulate - and supply a number (say 10) for that many steps.
        + runLongSimulation - for a simulation of 500 steps.
